## Introduction
I'm Jonggyu Park, a final-year PhD student at Sungkyunkwan University, advised by Young Ik Eom.
My research interests include operating systems, storage, and virtualization.
I am on the job market this year. 

You can find my [research statement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g5M-7rw3cRaolzXkQmrwOl69ZMSvbouk/view) and [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13PoY7sVMuswKV5z0l4ZcsFpt-iebhrQo/view?usp=sharing) here.

## Skill/experience
1. SSD internals - [C3, C4]
2. Linux kernel I/O stack (block layer, I/O schedulers, filesystems [ext4, f2fs, vfs], system calls) - [C1, J2, C3, C4]
3. I/O Cache (bcache, page cache) - [C2, J3]
4. Synchronization (mutex, spinlock, etc.) both inside the kernel and on the userspace - [C2, J3]
5. Cgroups v1 and v2 (CPU and I/O subsystems) - [J1, C2, J3, C4]
6. Docker container - [C2, J3, C4]
